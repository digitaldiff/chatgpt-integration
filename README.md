# ChatGPT Integration

The plugin adds a dropdown to every text field, as well as textarea, Redactor and CKEditor.

With this functionality, text can be automatically corrected, translated, shortened and created. And of course many other functions can be added individually. There are almost no limits.

The texts are directly forwarded to ChatGPT with the respective command. The commands can be entered globally in the settings.

For the plugin to work, an OpenAI ( https://openai.com/ ) account is required and an API key must be created.
